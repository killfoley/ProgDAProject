### Project Description
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook of a tolerance stackup analysis, on a linear assembly of multiple components using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The analysis is performed on behalf of the manufacturing department for the ficticious electric motor manufacturing company "Bratwurst Motors". The use of tolerancing is very important in the mechanical design process because it affects product quality and manufacturing cost. According to Wikipedia, Tolerance analysis is described as "the general term given to describe the study of accumulated variation in mechanical parts and assemblies". Tolerance stackup is a process used in mechanical engineering for calculating the effects of the accumulated variation that is allowed by specified dimensions and tolerances provided on manufacturing drawings. Monte Carlo simulation is a computational simulation method that relies on repeated random sampling according to a probability distribution to obtain numerical results.

### How to run the Notebook
#### Installation
It is recommended to install the Anaconda distribution which includes Python, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook and other commonly used libraries for data analysis and scientific computing. It can be installed by downloading the graphic installer from the Anaconda website, depending on your operating system.

#### Running the Jupyter Notebook
Clone the repository to your local machine and launch Jupyter Notebook by typing "Jupyter Notebook" in the command line from the same repository to start using the notebook. The Notebook is entitled "ProgDA_Project.ipynb"
